# GraphQL Versioning

Graphql Codegen generates types inside each version folder. The `types.ts` file inside each version in global types for that version and `**/types/index.ts` is the types file for each module for graphql API's.

The `types.ts` and `types/index.ts` files are autogenerated by codegen. They should not be modified manually.

When a new graphql version is added to the project, it needs to be added in `graphql.codegen.mjs` file as well.
